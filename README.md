Why to use?
For  police,  internet  communities  (the  internet  itself) represent  the  largest  of  electronic  neighborhoods.  
It  is  a neighborhood where distances can  be traversed with a single click, which is why the commission of crimes or malignant acts is at times much easier than it would 
be in physical (off-line) space.
Police writers primarily write on in a community police capacity  regarding  police  activities  that  have  infiltrated  the internet   and  social  media  venues;
the  key  here  is  the building of relationships and the development of dialogue with citizens.  Virtual  police  is  problem  oriented  and  based  on community  partnerships,
with  a  focus  on  prevention.  It attempts  to  establish  ties  between  police  forces  and  the potential victims of cyber criminals, to assist in the sharing of crime 
prevention  information  and  useful  practices,  and  to mitigate  fears  that  citizens  fundamentally  associate  with cybercrime.
